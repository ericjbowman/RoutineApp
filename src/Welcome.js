    <h1>Welcome to Lunkedin!</h1>
    <p>Lunkedin is an app that generates an exercise routine based on your
    squat, bench press, deadlift, and over-head press maximums. You can choose
    all other exercises. If you choose any of the recommended exercises, your
    maximums will be automatically generated based on your squat, bench press,
    and deadlift.
    </p>
    <p>This routine is ideal for lifters who want to get stronger, build muscle
    mass, and burn fat. The intensity undulates daily and weekly and progresses
    in a linear fashion monthly.
